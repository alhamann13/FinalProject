# FinalProject
Names: Sim Sandhu and Andrew Hamann

Project Description: This program will calculate a monthly income-to-expenses budget. The user inputs their total monthly income amount, which will then prompt the user to enter expenses they have. The user can enter as many categories as they choose (i.e. rent, water bill, electric bill, insurance, food, etc etc) continuously until the user types "done" when they have entered all of their expenses. The program will then execute the calculations for monthly income-to-expenses overview. The program will end by displaying their income, list their expenses, and then will inform the user how much of their budget is remaining. 

Details on how you tested that your project worked. For example, what inputs did you try to test it: We ran it many, many, many times, and thankfully GitHub was able to identify the lines that were incorrect so we weren't searching from beginning to end and helped us narrow down the errors we had. 

Short reflections (1â€“2 paragraphs): If we had more time and felt more comfortable, we would have had more functions entered in, such as taking the results at the end of the program to add recommendations for budget based on how close they came to their budget. Don't have much more to add for reflections. 

What you learned overall: Learning Python this quarter was enjoyable but challenging without a specific reference. Each lesson individually was a good challenge, but combining them all for this final project proved difficult. Having a book or other direct reference would have helped immensely throughout the quarter. 

The new Python feature or concept you explored: We researched something new and not too complex that would help us with our program, and ended up using TRY/EXCEPT. We learned its a better version of If/Else statements to gracefully reject an invalid input. Took many tries to get the indenting correct, placement in the code, and so on.  

Challenges you faced and how you overcame them: We forgot how functions worked, what their purpose was, why we should use them. Thankfully, we had Gavin in the tutoring center break them down for us in a simpler format, and did some further research how to implement the functions in our program. Their placement/order tripped us up several times
